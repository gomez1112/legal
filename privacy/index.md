# Privacy Policy

**Effective date:** 02/22/2026  
**Developer/Publisher:** Transfinite LLC (“we”, “us”)  
**Contact:** gerardgomez11@outlook.com  

This Privacy Policy explains how our apps (“Apps”) handle information. We design our Apps to be privacy-forward: data is stored on your device, and optional iCloud sync uses Apple’s CloudKit.

> **Summary**
> - Your content (like chats, notes, and outputs) is stored **on-device**. The App uses Apple Foundation Models.
> - If you enable iCloud, your content can sync using **Apple CloudKit**.
> - We do **not** run our own servers for your content, and we do **not** sell your data.
> - Purchases are processed by Apple via **StoreKit**.

---

## 1. Scope

This policy applies to all Apps published by transfinite LLC, unless an App includes an in-app link to a different, app-specific policy.

---

## 2. Information You Provide

Depending on the App, you may provide:
- **User content**: text you type (e.g., chats, notes, drafts), tags, titles, and other app data.
- **Files you import**: PDFs and images you choose to import for analysis or extraction.
- **Settings and preferences**: such as tone, display preferences, and feature selections.

We use this information **to provide the app’s functionality** (e.g., storing conversations, generating outputs, organizing items).

---

## 3. Device Processing (On-Device AI)

Some Apps include on-device intelligence features (for example, summarizing, rewriting, transforming text, or extracting text from images). When available, these features are designed to run **on your device**.

**Important:** Outputs generated by AI may be inaccurate. You are responsible for how you use them.

---

## 4. iCloud / CloudKit Sync (Optional)

If you enable iCloud for an App, it may sync content using **Apple CloudKit**, which helps keep your data consistent across your devices signed into the same Apple ID.

- Data synced through CloudKit is handled by Apple under Apple’s privacy practices.
- We do not operate the CloudKit service; Apple does.

If you disable iCloud for the App (or your device), content stays local to your device.

---

## 5. Purchases and Subscriptions (StoreKit)

If an App offers subscriptions or purchases:
- Payments are processed by Apple via **StoreKit**.
- We do not receive your full payment details (like your card number).
- Apple may provide us limited information such as subscription status (e.g., active/expired) to unlock features.

Refunds and billing are managed through Apple.

---

## 6. What We Collect Automatically

Our goal is to minimize data collection. Depending on the App configuration and Apple platform behavior, the App may process:
- **Basic diagnostics** (e.g., crashes) if you have enabled sharing diagnostics with developers in your device settings and Apple provides those reports.

If an App includes analytics or third-party SDKs, it will be disclosed in the **App-Specific Addendum** section below.

---

## 7. What We Do NOT Do

Unless explicitly stated in an App-Specific Addendum, we do not:
- Sell your personal data
- Track you across apps and websites
- Run our own servers to store your content
- Share your content with advertisers

---

## 8. Data Retention

- Your content remains on your device until you delete it.
- If iCloud sync is enabled, deletion may also propagate across devices and iCloud, depending on Apple’s sync behavior.
- If you uninstall an App, local data is removed from that device (iCloud-synced data may persist depending on Apple’s system behavior and your iCloud settings).

---

## 9. Security

We use Apple platform features (sandboxing, data protection, and iCloud security mechanisms where applicable) to help protect your data. No method of storage is 100% secure, but we aim to use reasonable safeguards.

---

## 10. Children’s Privacy

Our Apps are not intended for children under 13 unless the App listing explicitly states otherwise. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.

---

## 11. Your Choices

Depending on the App and device settings, you may be able to:
- Delete content inside the App (threads, messages, artifacts, library items)
- Disable iCloud sync for the App
- Control diagnostic sharing in your Apple device settings

---

## 12. Changes to This Policy

We may update this policy from time to time. The “Effective date” above will reflect the latest version. Material changes will be communicated in-app or via the App Store listing when appropriate.
